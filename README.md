gun-rtc
=======
WebRTC Communication layer for gunDB

> **Note:** this project is under development and unfinished.

## What is it
The idea is that you could replace
```html
<script src="gun.js"></script>
```
with
```html
<script src="gun-rtc.js"></script>
```
and automatically upgrade your boring websocket app to a decentralized, resiliant, offline-first, WebRTC driven app. Oh, and if WebRTC isn't supported, you can keep your websockets and still collab with the cool people on WebRTC.

## What's the holdup?
We've been holding off the heavy development until [gun's 0.3](https://github.com/amark/gun/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) release hit the masses. Now that most of the ecosystem has caught up with the release, we're ready to dive back in and build the future.

Star this repository to get occasional project updates and to aid my narcissism.
